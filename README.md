### Motivation
The principal motivation was to see if it was possible to make an appealing site without a single line of JavaScript.

Nowadays JavaScript is everywhere, but there are some areas where it's better not to use JavaScript, for example [Tor](https://www.torproject.org).

Also, sites that download lot of libraries, like Bootrap or jQuery, weight too much. This website is around 250 Kb with images included.
